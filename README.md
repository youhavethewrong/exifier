# exifixer

A program for setting images' timestamps from their Exif data.  It
annoys me when my digital photos don't have the right timestamp, so I
made this utility.  Maybe it'll be useful for you, too.

## Usage

    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar target/uberjar/exifixer-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar [directory]
